            <h2>Adoption Process</h2>
            <p>Before beginning the adoption process, it is required that you book a visit or drop-in to My Kitty Cafe (numbers permitting) to meet all of our PCON current resident kitties there.</p>
            <a href="https://mykittycafe.com/booking/">Book a Visit</a>
            <p>After you’ve met and interacted with a cat that you are interested in adopting, the next step is to submit the online Adoption Application. You cannot submit for a kitty you have just seen on the website. A visit is required or your application will not be considered.</p>
            <a href="https://www.purrfectcompanions.ca/adoption-application">Adoption Application</a>
            <p>Purrfect Companions of Norfolk does not necessarily approve applications in order of receipt. Our goal is to match the needs and personalities of our rescues to an adopter, striving to place the right cat into the right home.</p>
            <p>Once the best match has been selected, that applicant will be contacted. The final step in the adoption process is an adoption meeting at MKC with a PCON Adoptions Volunteer. Upon a successful meeting, the kitty will go home.</p>
